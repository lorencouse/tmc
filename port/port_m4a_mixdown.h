/*
 * MP2K track mixdown: per-track gain/pan, master volume, and the float->PCM16
 * quantise, extracted from RenderChunkLocked so it can be measured and tested
 * on the host.
 *
 * Why this is its own unit, and where it comes from: adapted from
 * EstebanPdN/zelda-tmc-3ds (GPL-3.0-or-later, same lineage as this tree).
 * A hardware dump there measured the audio worker at 5.367 ms per 15.64 ms
 * buffer -- 34% of one 268 MHz core -- of which the sequencer and software mix
 * (`m4aSoundMain`) accounted for only 0.349 ms. The other 93% was this
 * post-processing, which the code had assumed was the cheap half and which
 * nothing had measured.
 *
 * That was an ARM11 with a non-pipelined VFPv2, but the shape of the win is
 * memory traffic, not float throughput, so it carries to any handheld-class
 * core: the strategies below remove passes over the buffers rather than
 * arithmetic from them.
 *
 *   0 tracks  -> no float work at all; the output is silence. This is the case
 *                the DSP offload creates, and the old code still paid two
 *                accumulator fills plus a full quantise pass to produce zeros.
 *   1 track   -> quantise straight from the track, with no accumulator round
 *                trip (the old code wrote 2*frames floats and read them back).
 *   N tracks  -> the first track writes the accumulators instead of adding to
 *                a zeroed buffer, which removes both fills.
 *
 * Every strategy is bit-identical to the naive reference: adding 0.0f is exact
 * in IEEE754, and track summation order is preserved. port_m4a_mixdown_test
 * proves this over randomised and edge-case inputs rather than asserting it.
