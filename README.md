# Project Picori — Minish Cap PC Port

A native PC port of *The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap* (GBA, 2004) built on
SDL3, a vendored software PPU renderer (`port/ppu`), and the agbplay audio engine.
Targets **x86-64 Linux, Windows, and macOS** (Apple Silicon and Intel).

The port is **work in progress** — many rendering and gameplay paths are still
rough; please file issues for anything that breaks.

## Supported ROMs

A copy of the original game is required. This repository does **not** ship ROMs.

| Version | Filename         | SHA1                                       |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| USA     | `baserom.gba`    | `b4bd50e4131b027c334547b4524e2dbbd4227130` |
| EU      | `baserom_eu.gba` | `cff199b36ff173fb6faf152653d1bccf87c26fb7` |
| JP      | `baserom_jp.gba` | `6c5404a1effb17f481f352181d0f1c61a2765c5d` |

Current release builds are multi-region: the same `tmc_pc` binary validates
the loaded ROM by SHA-1 and selects USA, EU, or JP data at runtime. The
filenames above are the easiest setup path.

## Pre-built releases (recommended)

Pre-built tarballs are published on the [Releases page](https://github.com/999sian/tmc/releases).
Each tarball contains:

```
tmc_pc      sounds.json      assets/      assets_src/
```

The extracted asset cache under `assets/` (and the editable `assets_src/`) is keyed
per region in a subfolder — `assets/usa/`, `assets/eu/`, `assets/jp/` — so running
more than one regional ROM from the same install never mixes or corrupts another
region's data. The cache for each region is built automatically on first launch of
that ROM. `sounds.json` is shared across regions and stays at the top level.

Setup, once:

1. Download the platform tarball
   (`tmc-*-{linux,windows,macos}-<version>.tar.gz`) and unpack it anywhere.
2. Drop your own supported ROM next to the binary (`baserom.gba`,
   `baserom_eu.gba`, or `baserom_jp.gba`).
3. Run the game:

   ```sh
   ./tmc_pc                   # Linux / macOS
   tmc_pc.exe                 # Windows (double-click works)
   ```

On first launch, the binary self-extracts the runtime asset cache (≈3–5 s,
with a progress bar). Subsequent launches are instant. The binary resolves
the ROM, `sounds.json`, and asset trees relative to its own location, so the
install directory can live anywhere — no `cd` dance.

## Build from source

Place your ROM in the repository root, then run:

```sh
python3 build.py
```

The script will:

- Check and prompt to install missing dependencies (xmake, SDL3, libpng,
  fmt, nlohmann-json)
- Initialize git submodules automatically
- Scan ROM files and verify checksums
- Let you choose USA, EU, JP, or all configured versions
- Compile the native multi-region binary for your platform
- Place everything under `dist/<VERSION>/`

Run the result:

```sh
cd dist/USA
./tmc_pc
```

Saves are written to `tmc.sav` in the working directory, in the same byte
order mGBA/VBA-M use — a Minish Cap `.sav` from those emulators can be dropped
in as `tmc.sav` (and `tmc.sav` works in them, renamed to match the ROM).
Saves created by older Picori builds are migrated automatically on first
load; the original is kept as `tmc.sav.bak`.

### Dependencies

**Linux (Arch / CachyOS):**
```sh
sudo pacman -S xmake sdl3 libpng fmt nlohmann-json git curl
```

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):**
```sh
sudo apt install xmake libsdl3-dev libpng-dev libfmt-dev nlohmann-json3-dev git curl
```

**macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel):**
```sh
xcode-select --install                                                                            # Apple's compiler + git
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"   # Homebrew, if you don't have it
brew install xmake pkg-config fmt nlohmann-json libpng libomp
```

What each piece does, in plain English:

- **Xcode Command Line Tools** — Apple's C/C++ compiler (`clang`), linker, and
  `git`. You can't build any native code on a Mac without them, and Homebrew
  won't install them for you.
- **Homebrew** — the package manager that fetches everything else. If you've
  never used a Mac for development, this is the one prerequisite you'll
  always end up installing.
- **xmake** — the build system that drives the whole compile (think
  `make`/`cmake`, but it auto-downloads any C/C++ libraries that aren't
  already on your system).
- **pkg-config** — a tiny tool xmake uses to ask "where did Homebrew put
  libpng?". Without it, xmake can't find the brew-installed libraries and
  will rebuild them itself (slow and sometimes broken).
- **fmt** and **nlohmann-json** — small C++ helper libraries the asset tools
  and game code use for text formatting and JSON parsing.
- **libpng** — needed by the graphics tools to read and write PNG sprite
  sheets.
- **libomp** — Apple Clang doesn't ship with an OpenMP runtime, so VirtuaPPU's
  parallel scanline renderer needs Homebrew's `libomp`. If it's missing, the
  build still works but falls back to a single-threaded path.
- **SDL3** — the cross-platform window/input/audio layer. Not in the brew
  list because xmake builds its own copy automatically on macOS (the Linux
  path uses the system one when available, but on macOS the bundled build
  is the default and Just Works).

**Windows:** Install [xmake](https://xmake.io) and [git](https://git-scm.com).
SDL3 and other libraries are downloaded automatically by xmake.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for slim builds, the `xmake build tmc_pc`
single-target invocation, and other build options.

## Tested platforms

* Linux (Wayland preferred, X11 fallback)
* Windows via MinGW static link
* macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) — builds cleanly with Homebrew + Xcode
  Command Line Tools; lightly tested compared to Linux/Windows.

## Controls

| Action                         | Keyboard         | Gamepad        |
|--------------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Fast-forward (hold)            | Tab              | Right trigger  |
| Toggle fullscreen              | F11 / Alt+Enter  | —              |
| Cycle upscaler                 | F12              | —              |
| Toggle text-to-speech          | F7               | —              |
| Open debug menu                | F8               | —              |
| Capture bug report             | F9               | —              |
| Save state (selected slot)     | F5               | unbound        |
| Load state (also stops speech) | F6               | unbound        |
| State slot: next / previous    | PgDn / PgUp      | unbound        |
| Load state slot 2-5 directly   | F1-F4 (Shift=save) | —            |
| Roll attack macro              | D                | R3 (RS click)  |

Hold a direction, then press the roll-attack bind for a start-of-roll sword
attack (uses your best sword regardless of A/B equip). Toggle in **F8 →
Controls**. Rebindable there.

There are five manual state slots plus a three-deep auto-save ring. The four
save-state actions above act on whichever manual slot is **selected**, so four
bindings reach all five slots — pick the slot in **F8 → Saves**, or walk it
with the next/previous binds. The selection persists in `config.json`
(`savestate_slot`). All four are in the **F8 → Controls** binding table and
default to no gamepad button: on a handheld every pad button is already
gameplay, so the choice is yours rather than one being taken silently.

The **F8** debug menu also covers warp, items, heal, internal render scale,
the renderer/shader toggles (see *Renderer & shaders*) and an Accessibility tab
(see *Accessibility*).

Default upscaler is nearest-neighbor (sharp pixels). **F12** cycles through:
nearest-raw → xBRZ 4× (linear, smooth) → xBRZ 4× (nearest, sharp) → linear-raw.

The window title shows the running port version — please include it when
filing issues.

## Renderer & shaders

The default renderer is the vendored software PPU (`port/ppu`) presented through
SDL. An optional **SDL_GPU** backend adds post-processing shader presets (CRT,
LCD, scanline looks, …). In the **F8** menu:

- **Renderer** toggles software ↔ GPU.
- **CRT filter** cycles the stock CPU/GPU presentation filters.
- **Shader Preset** picks a `.glslp` preset when the SPIR-V/Vulkan GPU backend is active.

The GPU backend is compiled into the pre-built releases and `build.py` builds
it by default. A bare `xmake` configure needs `--gpu_renderer=y` — without it
the GPU options are present but show "GPU backend required". On macOS the GPU
backend uses Metal for the stock filters; runtime `.glslp` shader presets still
require the SPIR-V/Vulkan backend.

## Accessibility

The port has built-in text-to-speech for screen-reader users. Press **F7** to
toggle it on or off; dialog text, figurine descriptions, file-select hints and
other text surfaces are read aloud. While TTS is on, plain **F6** silences the
current utterance, and the **F8 → Accessibility** tab has rate / pitch / volume
sliders.

The speech backend is selected automatically per platform:

- **Windows** — the NVDA Controller Client if NVDA is running (using your
  configured NVDA voice; the F8 sliders are ignored while NVDA owns the queue),
  otherwise SAPI.
- **Linux / macOS** — the first available of `spd-say`, `espeak-ng`, `espeak`,
  or macOS `say`.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for per-release notes.

## Nix

A `flake.nix` is provided with all dependencies. Run the port directly with:

```sh
nix run
```

Or enter a development shell:

```sh
nix develop
```
